# Two bash scripts to automate the creation of folders and files in the Intro to Programming course at Epicodus

#### 8 Feb., 2017, v.1.0.0

#### By _Dallas Slaughter_

## Description

This is a set of scripts designed to streamline some of the repetitive parts of the first few days of the Epicodus or learnhowtoprogram.com Intro to Programming class. gartinit.sh takes several variables from the users (repo name, user initials, github usernames) then passes those on to the second script, gitAndRepoTool.sh to automate several processes. These include creating the project directory and index.html, css directory and styles.css within in, img directory, and several git commands (init, pair, add ., git-pair-commit, and remote add). If you are working solo, you will need to modify these scripts.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Put scripts on desktop either via USB or by cloning repo to desktop, cd to desktop and then run the first script by typing ./gartinit.sh into your terminal. Follow instructions and enjoy._


## Known Bugs

_You can confirm at the end of the first script with any key other than n, not just y. Any more bugs encountered, please let me know_

## Support and contact details

## Technologies Used
